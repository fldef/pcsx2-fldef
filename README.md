This is an archived fork of [PCSX2/pcsx2](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2) that fixes disc swapping in Monster Rancher EVO (see [bug #1](https://github.com/fldef/pcsx2-fldef/issues/1)) and SingStar ABBA (see [bug #2](https://github.com/fldef/pcsx2-fldef/issues/2)). Other Monster Rancher and SingStar games may be fixed as well.

Future work needed for Monster Rancher EVO:
* PCSX2 does not fully implement DVD TOC data. This is needed to correctly generate monsters from DVDs.
